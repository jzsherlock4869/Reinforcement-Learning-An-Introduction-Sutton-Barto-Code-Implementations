# Multi-armed Bandit 

**Multi-armed bandit (MAB)** is a quite simple and easy to implement toy problem for understanding the concept of reinforcement learning. The codes here solve the MAB by epsilon-greedy strategy, using the straightforward reward expectation as the Q value.

Preliminary results for the 5-armed bandit training for 200 epoches.
